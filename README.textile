h2. Description

RubyFedora and ActiveFedora provide a set of Ruby gems for creating and managing objects in the Fedora Repository Architecture ("http://fedora-commons.org":http://fedora-commons.org).  ActiveFedora is loosely based on "ActiveRecord" in Rails.

* Project Homepage: "http://yourmediashelf.com/activefedora":http://yourmediashelf.com/activefedora
* Community Discussions & Mailing List are located at "http://groups.google.com/group/active-fedora":http://groups.google.com/group/active-fedora

h2. Installation

The gem is hosted on gemcutter.

<pre>gem install active-fedora</pre>

h2. Getting Started

The "ActiveFedora Console Tour":http://hudson.projecthydra.org/job/active_fedora/Documentation/file.CONSOLE_GETTING_STARTED.html  gives you a brief tour through ActiveFedora's features on the command line.

h2. Testing (this Gem)

In order to run the RSpec tests, you need to have a copy of the ActiveFedora source code, and then run bundle install in the source directory.

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/mediashelf/active_fedora.git
cd /wherever/active_fedora/is
bundle install
git submodule init
git submodule update
</pre>

h3. Testing with Hudson Rake Task

The hudson rake task will spin up jetty, import the fixtures, and run the tests for you.

<pre>
  rake hudson
</pre>

h3. Testing Manually

If you want to run the tests manually, follow these instructions.

You need to have a copy of hydra-jetty running.  To do this, download a working copy of "hydra-jetty":https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-jetty, cd into its root and run 

<pre>
java -jar start.jar
</pre>

Then open a new terminal, go to your ActiveFedora source directory, and import fedora's demo objects.

<pre>
  export FEDORA_HOME=/path/to/hydra/jetty/fedora/default
  rake active_fedora:load_fixtures RAILS_ENV=test
</pre>

This does the equivalent of:

<pre>
  $FEDORA_HOME/client/bin/fedora-ingest-demos.sh localhost 8983 fedoraAdmin fedoraAdmin http
  rake af:import_fixture pid=hydrangea:fixture_mods_article1 RAILS_ENV=test
</pre>

Now you're ready to run the tests.  In the directory where active_fedora is installed, run

<pre>
  rake spec
</pre>

h2. Predicate Mappings

ActiveFedora versions 2.2.1 and higher provides specialized control over the predicate mappings used by SemanticNode.  In order to provide your own mappings, 
you must supply a predicate_mappings.yml in the same format as the config/predicate_mappings.yml file shipped with the ActiveFedora gem.  Place the file in the same directory
as your fedora.yml file and use the current method of initializing ActiveFedora:

<pre>
ActiveFedora.init("/path/to/my/config/fedora.yml")
</pre>

If no predicate_mappings.yml file is found, ActiveFedora will use the default mappings.
